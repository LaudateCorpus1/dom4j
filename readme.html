&lt;dom4j&gt; the flexible XML framework for Java

Introduction
--------------
Thank you for downloading DOM4J we hope you find it useful.
DOM4J is an open source framework for processing XML which is integrated with XPath and fully supports DOM, SAX, JAXP and the Java platform such as Java 2 Collections.


Building instructions
----------------------
The build process in DOM4J uses http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html. The prerequisites for running the Ant build system included with this release are that:

- You have a JDK installed on your machine such that the java executable is in your PATH

You have the JAVA_HOME environment variable defined to point to the directory in which the JDK is installed. For example on Windows this might be file:///C:/jdk1.3">C:\jdk1.3
or on Unix it might be /usr/local/jdk1.3.

To build this, run:
- ant compile : to compile the source
- ant package : to build the jar files
- ant test : to compile and run the tests (for what use they are)

In the root directory of this distribution there should be a script which runs on most popular operating systems to build a supplied target using Ant.

Choose the most suitable script for your platform from the scripts below and typing in the command line expression on the right hand side should display a list of available targets in the Ant
build system.

Changes as of 10th March 2021.
------------------------------
Fixing up the ant build:
- set classpath for compile and test targets to use the lib directory explicitly
- changed compiler to modern to work on java 8 and above
- modified the classes using reserved words like 'enum' that break the build over jdk 1.4
- removed not utf8 characters from a number of files

Applying the patch needed by security:
https://github.com/dom4j/dom4j/commit/bf0e58e48bbbdb3f315f94d61216c9544acae379?branch=bf0e58e48bbbdb3f315f94d61216c9544acae379

Refactored the test case for said patch to work with junit 3 rather than testng.
